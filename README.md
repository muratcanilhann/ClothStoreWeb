Check out the live demo of the project [here](https://mrtilhan-ecommerce.netlify.app/).

This project uses **Strapi CMS**, which is also available on my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/muratcanilhann/Strapi-Ecommerce), and it has been deployed on **Render**.

The design for this project was inspired by this [Figma UI Kit](https://www.figma.com/design/D3LjmWvmeGI9VjRIrStQ5a/Cloth-Store-%7C-Fashion-Store-%7C-E-commerce-UI-Kit-(Community)?node-id=0-1&node-type=canvas&t=nRFQFyqPI98b0U4H-0).
